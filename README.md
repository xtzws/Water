# Water
A lightweight water tracker for iOS.

## Purpose
I wanted a stupidly simple water tracker that:
- Has no upsells
- Has no ads
- Has no trackers
- Has no fluff

So I created an app that:
- Has no upsells
- Has no ads
- Has no trackers
- Has no fluff

Literally all it does is read water and save water. There aren't any customization options, no accounts to sign into. You can't even change the unit.

I've tried other trackers and they don't work for me because all I want to do is log water, but the app hides it behind screens and menus. Literally no reason for it to do that.

Anyway, if you like that idea, poke around in the code and download a copy if you want to try it out. Requires iOS 17 or above, but I'm sure it can be ported to other versions. DM if you do.

## Contributing
To be honest, I started this in January 2024. It hasn't seen any changes (except for a minor welcome message edit in March 2025) since then, and I'm not likely to modify it more, because it's essentially perfect. I'm not really sure how GitHub works so if you want to make changes, just be nice. Open an issue or something if that's what you're supposed to do.
